Hello!

Thank you so much for signing up for the follow-up interview! 
Your experience and perspective is invaluable to determine the effectiveness of the intervention.

Before the interview you need to have a look at and sign the informed consent, you can access it through this link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe8JbLpnMU_HwujxUUTJhjLMGlKABZdTYUEIo3qsGyzsU0x0A/viewform?usp=sf_link

If you have any questions regarding the informed consent, please let me know.

When do we have the interview?
I realize that it can be tricky to schedule a time to do the interview given full time work and other engagements, therefore I think it would be best if you decide on a time that suits you. 
I should be able to accomodate any time that you choose in the upcoming 7 days (including the weekend). 
We can also do it over whichever communication platform you prefer(Zoom, Google Meet etc). 

If you want you can invite me to a meeting at a time of your choosing, or get back to me with just the date and time and I will send you an invite, if so please let me know which platform you prefer.

Have a great day!
Christopher
