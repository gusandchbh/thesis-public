Hello!

It has now been 28 full days since you filled in the entry questionnaire and that means the 4 week intervention is now over. 

If you want to take part in a follow-up interview (20-30 minutes) where your experience during the intervention is explored, you can sign up for it in the exit questionnaire. 
I would be very interested in hearing your perspective!

If you do not wish to take part in the follow-up interview, filling in the exit questionnaire concludes your participation in this study.

To fill in the exit questionnaire you just head on over to https://mindfulness-thesis.vercel.app/, log in and it will be shown.

I would again  like to express a heartfelt thank you for taking the time to participate! 

Have a great day!
Christopher
