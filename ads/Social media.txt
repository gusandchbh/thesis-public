Are you are Software Engineer working at least 40% remotely? Look here!

Software engineering can be very stressful and the fact is that Software engineers are at a higher risk than many other occupations of suffering from burnout. At the same time we are seeing a large shift in software engineering towards working in remote/hybrid work environments, and while there are benefical aspects of this it also creates new challenges in terms of work-life balance, taking fewer breaks and working longer hours.
This calls for effective stress management strategies to improve resilience i.e. the ability to bounce back from stress.

My bachelor thesis investigates if a brief breathing technique known as '4-7-8 breathing' can have a positive impact on resilience in this context. To help me assess this I am looking for participants to take part in a breathing intervention. The details of the intervention are as follows:
- Fill in pre-intervention questionnaire related to your resilience, well-being and work engagement
- Practice 4-7-8 breathing twice daily for four weeks
- Fill in a post-intervention questionnare containing the same set of questions
- Optionally, you can choose to take part in a follow-up interview where your experience is discussed

You may be thinking that it's a large commitment to perform this breathing practice twice daily for four weeks.
My answer to this is that I agree, I'm essentially asking you to build a new habit and that can be tough, but I would like you to consider the following:
- Each breathing session takes just over a minute
- By building this habit you will be acquiring a tool that can help you relax in stressful situations
- I have a set up a website where you will have access to an animation that guides you through the breathing practice and where you will be able to track your progress
- Your participation is anonymised and your data is kept safe

If you think this sounds interesting please feel free to reach out to me directly or by visiting the website where you can read more about the study and sign up: https://mindfulness-thesis.vercel.app/

Have a great day!
