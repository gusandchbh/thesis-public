## Use the code from this repository

Clone this repository and the repository that was just created. <br>
Copy over the following folders from this repository: `app`, `components`, `providers`, `public`, `utils` along with `middleware.ts`.

## Create tables in Supabase
Open the SQL Editor in your Supabase project: 
```sql
CREATE TABLE session_data (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID NOT NULL,
date DATE NOT NULL,
session_count INT NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_progress (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID NOT NULL,
consent_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
entry_survey_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
exit_survey_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
days_completed INT NOT NULL
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE survey_responses (
response_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
user_id UUID NOT NULL,
survey_type VARCHAR NOT NULL,
response_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
question_id VARCHAR NOT NULL,
response VARCHAR NOT NULL
);
```
Once the tables are created it is recommend that you enable row level security and set up appropriate policies.

## Run the project
To run the project locally:
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```
To push to Vercel you just push the changes to GitHub.
